            <p> Note: Usually, when you would be trying to get someone's cookie, the best way would be to write a fetch that fetches silently to your own server and you can just collect cookies there. Simulating that would be difficult, as that would require everyone to set up their own server to fetch to. Possible, just difficult. </p>
