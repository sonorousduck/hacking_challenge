 Achievements

## Adding Achievements
    - You can add it to the preexisting database, or add it to the migration script.
    - There are a few parameters that you must fill out.
    - Title: Give the achievement a name. It will automatically display this when earning it
    - Description: Gives the achievement a description. 
    - Achievement Icon: Gives the achievement a photo.
    - Earned: For the medals you only want one person to get, this is an optional parameter that you can use (Default: False)

## Making the Achievements Possible to Earn
    - Go to the challenges app. In views, under validation this is where the server validates if the user got the challenge correct.
    - There is a block of code that handles a lot of the achievements. Add it in there. (This will be a function that I add, just add to there)
