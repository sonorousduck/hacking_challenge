# Creating an Account on Digital Ocean

1. Have the new user create a Digital Ocean Account. If I remember right, it shouldn't need a credit card.
    a. If for some reason it does, you shouldn't have to pay at least.
2. The rest must be done by Erik or another Owner of the USU CTFd.

3. Go into Digital Ocean
4. Go to the project and on the left bar, click on settings
5. Scrolling down, there should be a section that says members.
6. If you are an owner, invite new members and they will have to accept it.
7. From there, the new team member then has access to this project. However, that being said, there really isn't much you will ever have to do on this website. Most everything will just be down through the SSH server.
